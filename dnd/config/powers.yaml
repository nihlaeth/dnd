  <p>Scanning an object requires a DC of 10. A successful scan reveals the presence of any magical powers. A DC of 14 reveals the process of activation of these powers.</p>

  <p>A suggestion requires a verbal component, and the ability to communicate with the target. If the saving throw is failed, the suggestion sounds completely reasonable to the target.
