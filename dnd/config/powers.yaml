  <p>If the caster wants to attack with an object, the power-check counts as an attack roll. The amount of damage is determined by that result, which must be high enough to move the object. An object that is attached or bolted down, is treated as if it is one category heavier.</p>
  <p>When moving multiple objects, the base DC is set by the heaviest object, and each additional object adds a +2 to the DC. When doing this, the caster cannot attack with any of the objects.</p>
