  <p>This skill allows the character to change the range of his wizard spells and warlock powers from short to medium, or from medium to long. It cannot upgrade range from short to long.</p>
  <p>Wizards use up one circle of their reserve to do this. Therefore, they cannot do this to a spell of their highest circle.</p>
  <p>When warlocks use alcance, they face a -4 penalty to the power-check.</p>

  <p>This skill reflects the character's rapport with animals. He can herd domestic animals and lead pack animals or work animals.</p>
  <p>This skill is also used to train animals to do tricks. It must be specified to apply to one of three groups of animals: pets (dogs or cats), birds (falcons or pigeons) or mounts (including cattle).</p>
  <p>An animal is automatically taught one trick, depending on its type, and one other chosen by the trainer. Pets automatically learn to guard, birds learn to come to the lure, and mounts learn to carry a rider.</p>
  <p>It takes approximately 1 week for the animal to learn its automatic trick, and 1 month to learn its second trick. Both tricks require a skill-check. If the skill-check is failed, the training must begin anew, with a cumulative -4 modifier. Tricks are as follows.
  <ul>
  <li>attack: the animal attacks the same target as its master does. Treat this as an extra attack.</li>
  <li>battle-mount: the rider doesn't have to roll a riding-check if the mount takes damage.</li>
  <li>carry a rider: the animal allows an appropriately-sized rider on its back.</li>
  <li>come to the lure: the animal comes to its master when food is offered.</li>
  <li>expert mount: the animal has a +3 handling if used as a mount.</li>
  <li>go home: the animal will go to a location specified during training.</li>
  <li>guard: the animal gains the alertness skill and watches for approaching strangers.</li>
  <li>hunt: the animal flushes or attacks prey, granting the master a +4 to craft (hunter) for a predator pet or bird, +1 otherwise.</li>
  <li>sheep dog: the animal grants its master a +2 to animal handling (+4 for a dog or pig).</li>
  <li>track: the animal grants its master a +4 to tracking, provided it has appropriate senses.</li>
  <li>wagon-trained: the animal can pull a cart, chariot, plough or sled, and be part of a team.</li>

This check has a -8 penalty if the character doesn't know the target's name, and a -8 penalty if he doesn't know the target's date of birth.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, this skill can be used to foretell the future. However, as often as not predicting what will come attracts the anger of gods and demons. Trying this without the DM's approval is suicidal. At best.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to do 1d6 extra damage when backstabbing. Furthermore, specialists can invest SP to do even more damage. For every 5 SP they invest, another 1d6 extra damage is gained. A backstab can be achieved through the use of the stealth-skill, the tumbling-skill, or the quickdraw-skill.</p>
  <p>A backstab still requires a to hit roll, but the attack has a +4 bonus.</p>
  <p>The backstab-skill is also useful in regular combat. When a character with this skill attacks an enemy that is also being attacked by another character, a so-called flanking attack, he gains a +1 to hit and does 1 extra point of damage, plus 1 point for every 5 SP invested.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to keep a single spirit or undead at bay. This is resolved by a power-check, using the character's priest level and his [cha]. The power-check determines the DC of the undead's saving throw vs will. The speed of this action is 3.</p>
  <p>Banishment works against a single target in short range. The character must concentrate on the attempt, so he can take no other actions. If the target fails the save, he cannot attack the priest and may even flee (depending on the DM). Once the target has failed his save, the character can maintain the effect as long as he concentrates, as if it was a spell or prayer with "duration: concentration".</p>
  <p>Banishment requires a holy symbol.</p>
  <p>This skill may also work on demons, halflings and other unnatural creatures. Check with your DM.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to do more damage from a charge. Instead of inflicting 1 extra point of damage, he does double weapon damage. Other bonuses, such as from strength, weapon specialisation or the magic on the weapon, are not doubled; only the weapon damage is rolled twice. Furthermore, every 3 SP invested in the skill grant another +1 to damage when charging.</p>
  <p>A charge requires a space of 10 meters, but characters with skill focus (charging) require only 5 meters.</p>
  <p>A character with the riding skill can use the charging skill on horseback, inflicting triple weapon damage. A mounted charge requires at least 20 meters of space. If the stirrup is invented, then the rider can use a large spear to inflict 1d6 extra damage from the momentum of the horse in addition to the normal charging bonus, always attacking before his target can attack in melee, unless his target also uses a large weapon.</p>

  <p>On a successful skill-check, the character can perform special maneuvers. For instance, he can jump obstacles or attack using his vehicle as a weapon. The DM may assign a modifier for the more insane maneuvers.</p>
  <p>Trampling an enemy is done by riding over him, rolling a charioteering-check. Anyone in the path must roll a save vs reflex with a DC of 10, plus 2 for every horse 'wide'. Failure of this save inflicts 2d8 blunt damage.</p>

  <p>On a successful skill-check, the character can prospect an area for ores. This process takes many days, depending on a variety of circumstances.

  <p>Smelting ore into metal depends on the technology level of the setting. As a general rule, cutting edge metal (bronze in the bronze age, iron in the iron age) takes a long time to make, about 10 days per metal bar, or clump.

  <p>An attempt to remove a curse costs at the very least 1 dies of supplies, and 1 hour, and it may cost substantially more, depending on the DM.</p>
  <p>A curse can only be treated if it is known to the exorcist. Only one curse, chosen by the exorcist, is treated at a time.</p>
  <p>Having a curse removed is often a traumatic moment. The DM may devise more specific rules for the situation. It must be noted that different exorcists exercise this skill in wildly varying ways. This may seem ridiculous, but the evidence suggests that targets who make fun of the exorcist automatically ruin the attempt.</p>
  <p>If in doubt, curses can be defined as magic affecting a person with a permanent duration.</p>

  <p>This skill is a special case. It represents the character's ability to talk his way out of an embarrassing, or even dangerous, situation. It is always an opposed skill-check, but there is no opposing skill (the target is assumed to have it, but to have spent no skill points in it).</p>
  <p>A successful skill-check allows the character to confuse the target for one round. Additional targets make this a group check.</p>
  <p>The DM is encouraged to roleplay the encounter, but some characters are more charismatic than their players, or sometimes there just isn't time in the storyline. If that is the case, then a fast-talking-check is in order.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to help the wounded, the poisoned and the sick. It also grants knowledge of plants that aid in healing.</p>
  <p>A successful skill-check stabilizes a dying creature (one in negative hit points). This is an action with a speed of 3.</p>
  <p>If a healer tends to a wounded creature, he doubles its natural rate of healing on a successful skill-check, making it 4 hp and 2 ability points per night of rest, and 2 hp per day. This requires a group check, but the first patient is ignored when calculating the penalty. When taking care of patients during the night, the healer doesn't rest enough to regain magic, hit points or ability points himself.</p>
  <p>A healer can also attempt to treat a poisoned creature. This takes one turn, after which a successful healing-check allows the target a new saving throw to resist the poison. Every extra turn spent to refine the treatment confers no bonuses to the healing-check, but grants a +1 to the target's saving throw. Once a save is rolled, the bonus resets to 0.</p>
  <p>Diseases can also be treated, but this is a slower process. The healer spends a day or a night tending his patient, after which he rolls a power-check using his priest level and his [wis]. The DC is 5 plus the total number of ability points that the patient is below his normal scores. If the check is a success, then the patient is cured, but he retains any ability damage. If the check fails, the patient suffers 1d3 points of constitution-damage. The DM may rule that specific diseases have their own effects, and set their own DCs.</p>
  <p>On a successful healing-check taking one round, the character can see how many hit points of damage the target has sustained. He does not know the target's maximum health.</p>

  <p>In combat, the character can taunt, an action with a speed of 2. It requires a power-check with the character's fighter level and his charisma. He can target either a single target, or all enemies in short range.</p>
  <p>Any targets that fail a saving throw vs will, must focus their action for the next round on the intimidating character. Normally, they will attack or run away. If there is only a single target, then the character may attack this target at the end of the round in which he taunts (if the target is in melee range).</p>
  <p>Outside of combat, a successful intimidation-check convinces the target that the character is a serious threat. This may cause him to run away, or tell him what he wants to hear, or face him down; it's hard to predict.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to create magical items. To do so, he needs an item to enchant, and access to the magic he wants to imbue into the item.</p>
  <p>The item to enchant can be anything, but using a masterwork item grants a +4 bonus to the skill-check.</p>
  <p>Access to the magic is easiest if the character is a magic himself, but a vellum, or even another item, can function as well. If such is the case, the character faces a -4 to the skill-check.</p>
  <p>It takes a day, the item, the magic and 1 annum of supplies to enchant the item. Then the character rolls a skill-check. The supplies are consumed by the attempt.</p>
  <p>Magic that gives a passive modifier is the easiest. The item gains a +1 modifier, and a +1 for every 5 points with which the check is made. This works for spells such as imbuement or cloak, for prayers such as battlefate or endure elements, and for warlock powers such as iron will.</p>
  <p>If the duration of the magic is instantaneous, only one charge per session is imbued into the item. The caster level of the effect is the minimum needed to use the magic.</p>
  <p>The creation of more complicated items must be adjudicated by the DM.</p>
  <p>The DM can inflict a penalty to the skill-check if the item is incompatible with the effect. Crowns do not generally help stealth, and swords do not boost etiquette.</p>

  <p>This skill represents knowledge of how physical and magical laws interact, and how varying such laws will affect magic.

  <p>The material world is adjacent to two different planes. On the one side is the ursuppe, the place where all the matter and energy in the world originates.

The spirit world holds the different realms of the spirits.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to draw and sheathe weapons and switch them between hands very fast. These actions do not delay his initiative as they do for others.</p>
  <p>Out of combat, quickdraw can be used to create an opportunity for a backstab, as per the backstab skill. To do this, the character rolls a skill-check at a speed of 1, opposed by alertness. A small weapon has no penalty to the skill-check, a medium weapon -4 and a large weapon a -8. If the check succeeds, then the character can attempt a backstab, delayed by his weapon speed. If the check fails, he can still attack normally, but he faces a -2 to hit.</p>
  <p>Once combat has been joined, quickdraw is less useful. Instead of gaining a backstab, the character merely gains a flanking attack, as explained in the backstab skill. On a failed check, he can still attack normally.</p>
  <p>A character without the backstab skill who uses quickdraw gains no bonuses to his attacks. A character without the ambidexterity skill faces an additional -2 penalty to flanking attacks created using this skill.

  <p>This skill grants the character familiarity with the different forms and rites of spellcasting. If he observes and overhears someone who is casting a spell or prayer, or if he examines the material components used, he can attempt to identify the magic. A skill-check must be rolled to make a correct identification. Note that since the spellcaster must be observed until the very instant of casting, the spellcraft skill does not grant an advantage against observed spells.</p>
  <p>This skill can also research new prayers and spells. These must be approved by the DM, and the research takes time and money. A skill-check determines its success or failure.</p>
  <p>The cost of the magic is the magic's circle squared. The character pays this price with time and money. The unit for time is the week, and the unit for money is 100 dies. Price = time x money. The minimum time is one week. The minimum money is 100 dies.</p>
  <p>For instance, a 5th circle spell costs 25. If the wizard wants to research the spell in 3 weeks, he pays 834 dies. If he wants to minimize the money, he can spend 100 dies and 25 weeks instead. At the DM's discretion, the wizard can research spells without any money at all. In this case, the weeks change to years.</p>
  <p>With all this, the wizard has earned a spellcraft-check to finish the spell. The check has a penalty equal to the spell's circle. If the check is passed, the spell is researched and the character has learned how to cast it.</p>
  <p>If the check is failed, the wizard can gain another check by spending more time and money, equal to 10% for every point with which the check is failed. The minimum time is one week, the minimum money is 100 dies.</p>
  <p>If this skill is used to research a prayer, the new prayer replaces an old prayer that the priest removes from his prayer list.</p>
  <p>Repeated failures can bring interesting results. On a natural 20, the character is incompatible with the spell.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to sneak past, or up to, a target. It is therefore always used against a target. This skill can set up a target for a backstab. Stealth is opposed by alertness.</p>
  <p>If there are more targets, every additional target imparts a -2 penalty to the skill-check.</p>
  <p>Surroundings are also a factor. Sneaking through darkness is easier, and getting through a castle gate is hard. Underbrush can grant up to a +4 bonus. In heavier underbrush it may be easier to remain unseen, but it's often harder to remain unheard, so more than a +4 is very rare.</p>
  <p>Distance is also a modifier. For every 3 meters distance to his target, the character gains a +1 bonus to stealth.</p>
  <p>Carrying a source of light makes stealth very difficult. For every -1 penalty to vision that is negated by the light, a -4 penalty is inflicted on the stealth-check.</p>

  <p>This skill teaches the character to survive in the wild, of a sort. It enables him to find water, shelter and a meagre amount of edible plants and other food. It does not include hunting, tracking or trapping, or anything that is covered in another skill, such as fire-building, but on a successful skill-check the character can stay alive in the wilderness.</p>
  <p>A human needs at least 2 liters of water every day, but he can survive for weeks without food. A person without food loses 1 point of constitution per 3 days, but a person who has gone 2 days without water loses 1 point of constitution every 3 hours.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to swim. This is a highly useful skill that many learn too late.</p>
  <p>Most of the time, characters with swimming automatically succeed on their skill-check. Other characters must still roll. A skilled swimmer can help another, but this requires a group-check. Swimming in wild water or swimming underwater requires a skill-check from even the most experienced swimmer.</p>
  <p>Combat while swimming is extremely hazardous. A character who knows swimming has a -3 to hit and AC, and has a +3 penalty to initiative. A character without swimming doubles those penalties.</p>
  <p>A character can hold his breath underwater for one round per 3 points of constitution. If he is still underwater after that, he is reduced to -1 hit points and starts dying.</p>

  <p>This skill allows a character to follow and hide tracks. In both cases, the check is opposed by tracking. A creature using this skill moves at half his normal speed.</p>
  <p>The following modifiers apply to the tracker, to be reversed if the character is being tracked:</p>
  <table>
  <tr><td>soft or muddy ground</td><td>+4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>thick brush, vines or reeds</td><td>+3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>occasional signs of passage, dust</td><td>+2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>normal ground, wood floor</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>rocky ground or shallow water</td><td>-10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>every 2 creatures in the lead group</td><td>+1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>every 12 hours lead</td><td>-1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>every hour of rain, snow or sleet</td><td>-5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>poor lighting (moon or starlight)</td><td>-6</td></tr>

  <p>Craft (hunter) is the prerequisite for this skill.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to perform various acrobatic maneuvers. The character can walk ledges, do flips and spins, and jump farther. He can even walk a tightrope on a check with a -10 penalty. A successful skill-check allows him to stand up with a speed of 1 instead of 5.</p>
  <p>A character may roll a tumbling-check when he's falling. If successful, he reduces the falling damage by 1d6.</p>
  <p>Running on water requires a skill-check with a -20 penalty, with a -5 for every step beyond the first.</p>
  <p>The character can also use this skill to avoid attacks. To do this, he rolls a skill-check with a speed of 1. If successful, he then gains a +1 bonus to AC, with an added +1 for every 3 points with which he makes the check. This bonus lasts until his action in the next round. If he wishes to continue this action, he must roll a new check every round. While avoiding, he can take no other actions.</p>
  <p>Tumbling can also be used, in combination with the backstab skill, to attack a target for extra damage. To do this, the character rolls a tumbling-check at a speed of 1. This check grants the character the regular bonus to AC, but only against his specified target. If the skill-check succeeds by as many points as the target has AC, or more, then the character can make an attack. This attack is normally a backstab, but if the target has seen the character use a tumbling attack (within a reasonable amount of time, DM's decision) then the attack is a flanking attack instead. The attack is of course delayed by weapon speed.</p>

  <p>This skill enables the character to choose a single weapon and specialise in its use. This can be any weapon that the character has weapon training in. However, where the weapon training skill allows the character to use an entire category of weapons, a weapon specialist applies his bonus only to one size of one category (for instance large swords, or medium sabres).</p>
  <p>The character gains a +1 bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to damage when attacking with the weapon type in question. If the character has at least one fighter level, he also gains an extra attack every second round. This extra attack takes place at the end of the round.</p>
  <p>A character cannot specialise in more than one weapon. However, he can switch. To do this, he trains the second specialisation, gaining its benefits and losing the benefits of his first specialisation. One level later he regains the now vacant skill slot of his first specialisation.</p>
  <p>For the purpose of skill mastery, weapon specialist is regarded as the skill focus for weapon training.</p>

  <p>This skill reflects the character's knowledge of how to properly use a weapon. When using it, he does not suffer any class penalty for lack of training.</p>
  <p>There are several broad categories of weapons: maces, axes, spears, swords and sabres. A character who trains in their use is proficient in all weapons in that category. Bows and crossbows together form a sixth category. A character who trains in a weapon outside of these categories has learned to use only that weapon.</p>
  <p>An untrained character faces a -4 to hit, unless he has at least one level in the fighter class, in which case he faces only a -2 to hit.</p>

  <p>This skill gives the character the opportunity to have multiple attacks in the same round. For every additional attack the character wants, he faces a -3 penalty to hit on all attacks. The first attack takes place at the usual time in the initiative order. For every additional attack, add the weapon speed to the initiative (minimum increase of 2).</p>
  <p>The character can only accept a penalty equal to the to hit bonus he gains from his classes. For example, it would take a 6th level fighter, or a 12th level priest, to gain 2 additional attacks.</p>

  <p>This skill allows the character to strengthen spells, prayers and powers that have no somatic components. He adds somatic components to the magic, and rolls a skill-check. If the check is successful, then the magic is treated as if his caster level  was one level higher.</p>
  <p>The skill-check is rolled before the ability cost from warlock powers is applied.</p>
